# PPP-4-reflecting-on-coding-paradigms- In this activity, we will get a chance to express what we've learned so far in regards to the paradigms of Functional and Object-Oriented Programming in Python. The activity will be completed in a few distinct stages. The first step will consist of implementing a solution to a problem for each coding style. Once a solution that adheres to the coding paradigm has been implemented, there are several questions to answer. These questions pertain to how and why the coding paradigm in question helps us solve the problem. When answering these questions, it may be helpful to envision an interview setting. The final part of the activity consists of a writing prompt to reflect on the past two modules, and your personal impressions of them.# PPP-4-reflecting-on-coding-paradigms
